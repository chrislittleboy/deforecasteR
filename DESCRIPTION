Package: deforecasteR
Title: Agent-Based Simulation of Deforestation
Description: This package is an agent-based model which simulates deforestation as a public good conflict where forests are both a resource to be consumed by local populations and a resource to be conserved by governments.
    The location of agents in our model can be generated, or use input data from gridded population count data such as LandScan or WorldPop.
    Likeise, the location of trees in our model can be generated, or use input data from numerous remote sensing sources on forest cover such as Hansen, MODIS.
