Today, forests globally are receding at an unprecedented rate. 
At COP26, world leaders pledged to end or reverse deforestation by 2030. 
Achieving this will require immediate and extensive policy action. 

This package is an agent-based model which simulates deforestation as a public good conflict where forests are both a resource to be consumed by local populations and a resource to be conserved by governments.

The location of agents in our model can be generated, or use input data from gridded population count data such as LandScan or WorldPop.
Likeise, the location of trees in our model can be generated, or use input data from numerous remote sensing sources on forest cover such as Hansen, MODIS.

We intend for the model to be used to simulate future deforestation in existing forests.
Model parameters can be tuned to best reflect local conditions.
