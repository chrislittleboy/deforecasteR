#' @param explicit If FALSE, places people and trees randomly on the landscape. If TRUE takes input data.
#' 
#' @param ppl_loc Only if explicit_people is TRUE. A 4 column matrix with id, x/y locations and budget.
#' @param ppl_scaling Only if explicit_people is TRUE. A number between 0 and 1 to scale down the # of people on the map.
#' @param ppl_n Only if explicit_people is FALSE. The number of people on the landscape.
#'
#' @param xdim Size of landscape on x axis.
#' @param ydim Size of landscape on y axis
#' 
#' @param budget The starting resources of people on the landscape.
#' 
#' @param p_loc Only if explicit_trees is TRUE. A 4 column matrix with ID, x/y location and age of protected trees.
#' @param np_loc As p_loc, but for unprotected trees.

#' @param sd_age Standard deviation of tree age.
#' 
#' @param p_n The number of protected trees on the landscape.
#' @param np_n The number of unprotected trees on the landscape.
#' 
#' @param travel_cost The cost for a person to move one grid cell to fell a tree.
#' @param management_cost The cost for a person to fell a tree in a protected area.
#'
